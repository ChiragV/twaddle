### Ideas
##### (Amazon) Group buying : The basic idea of group buying is that buyers come together to approach a vendor about buying a particular product in bulk ( at discounted price ).
#### Why OTT platforms don't provide option to "watch movie with family" where controversial/uncomfortable scenes can be removed.
#### Alert me if my favorite show/movie ( i.e. added to "My List" ) is leaving Netflix in near future so we better watch it early.

## Finance
#### Why US finance companies(like Fidelity ) don't show XIRR (Extended Internal Rate of Return ) returns of my investment. IMHO, this is the best and only method used to calculate (actual) returns on investments where there are multiple transactions happening at different times.


## Math 
#### In school I never understood what the "Vector" or "Scalar" means.
