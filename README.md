## Ideas
##### (Amazon) Group buying : The basic idea of group buying is that buyers come together to approach a vendor about buying a particular product in bulk ( at discounted price ).
##### Why OTT platforms don't provide option to "watch movie with family" where controversial/uncomfortable scenes can be removed.
##### Alert me if my favorite show/movie ( i.e. added to "My List" ) is leaving Netflix in near future so we better watch it early.

## Finance
##### Why US finance companies(like Fidelity ) don't show XIRR (Extended Internal Rate of Return ) returns of my investment. IMHO, this is the best and only method used to calculate (actual) returns on investments where there are multiple transactions happening at different times.


## Math 
##### In school, I never understood what the "Vector" or "Scalar" means.

## Machine Learning
##### We (human being) work on remember,formulate,predict framework (from Grokking Machine Learning by Luis G. Serrano). ML work on predict,compare and learn framework (Grokking Deep Learning by Andrew W. Trask).
##### To regress is to return to a former state or condition. Linear Regression roughly means fitting a line through a set of points and then using that line to make predictions.
